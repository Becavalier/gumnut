A fast, permissive JavaScript tokenizer and parser in C.
Assumes code written in "module mode", and should support all ECMAScript language features in the [draft specification](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) (as of May 2020).

This code is intended for rewriting tasks, and can be compiled via Web Assembly for the web (or Node).
It does not generate an AST as part of its work.

## Coverage

prsr correctly parses all 'pass' and 'pass-explicit' tests from [test262-parser-tests](https://github.com/tc39/test262-parser-tests), _except_ those which:

- rely on non-strict mode behavior (e.g., use variable names like `static` and `let`): modules run in strict mode by default
- use the `NULL` byte inside a string.

## Note

JavaScript has a single 'after-the-fact' ambiguity, as `async` is not a keywordâ€”even in strict mode.
Here's an example:

```js
// this is a function call to a method "async"
async(/* anything can go here */) {}

// this is an async arrow function
async(/* anything can go here */) => {}
```

See [arrow functions break JavaScript parsers](https://dev.to/samthor/arrow-functions-break-javascript-parsers-1ldp) for more details.

The parser resolves this ambiguity, but has a pathological expansion in some cases.
And, for this parser to be useful as a bundler, non-async arrow functions also require this expansion: i.e., does `(` start an arrow function, or normal parens?

The pathological expansion triggers where further arrow functions are found in the _arguments_ of an arrow function, e.g.:

```js
(a =
  (b =
    async (c =
      (final = () => {}) => {}
    ) => {}
  ) => {}
) => {}
```

The above code (with five layered ambiguities) will result in 1+2+4+8+16 extra passes over this section, or `(2^depth - 1)` extra passes.

At a minimum, any section that is ambigiously an arrow function will be parsed twice.
